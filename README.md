Monitors publish availability and collects related metrics. Collected metrics are sent to various systems (ex. Splunk).

# Installation

1. Download the source code, dependencies, and build the binary:

```
go get github.com/Financial-Times/publish-availability-monitor
go build
```

2. Set all environment variables listed in `startup.sh`.

3. Run 
````
startup.sh
````

With Docker:

`docker build -t coco/publish-availability-monitor .`

`docker run -it --env QUEUE_ADDR=<addr> --env S3_URL=<S3 bucket URL> --env CONTENT_URL=<document store api article endpoint path> --env LISTS_URL=<document store api lists endpoint path> --env NOTIFICATIONS_URL=<notifications read path> --env NOTIFICATIONS_PUSH_URL=<notifications push path> --env METHODE_ARTICLE_TRANSFORMER_URL=<methode article transformer URL>  --env METHODE_CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER_MAPPER_URL=<methode content placeholder mapper URL> coco/publish-availability-monitor`

# Build and deploy
__Note that deployment to FTP2 is no longer supported.__
* Tagging a release in GitHub triggers a build in DockerHub.

# Endpoint Check Configuration

```
//this is the SLA for content publish, in seconds
//the app will check for content availability until this threshold is reached
//or the content was found  
"threshold": 120,
```

```
//Configuration for the queue we will read from
"queueConfig": {
	//URL(s) of the messaging system
	"address": [queue address1, queue address 2],
	//The group name by which this app will be knows to the messaging system
	"group": "YourGroupName",
	//The topic we want to get messages from
	"topic": "YourTopic",
	//the name of the queue we want to use
	"queue": "yourQueue"
},
```

```
//for each endpoint we want to check content against, we need a metricConfig entry
"metricConfig": [
{
	//the path (or absolute URL) of the endpoint.
	//paths are resolved relative to the read_url setting (see below) on a per-environment basis
	//to check content, the UUID is appended at the end of this URL
	//should end with /
	"endpoint": "endpointURL",
	//used to associate endpoint-specific behavior with the endpoint
	//each alias should have an entry in the endpointSpecificChecks map
	"alias": "content",
	//defines how often we check this endpoint
	//the check interval is threshold / granularity
	//in this case, 120 / 40 = 3 -> we check every 3 seconds
	"granularity": 40
},
{
	"endpoint": "endpointURL",
	"granularity": 40,
	"alias": "S3",
	//optional field to indicate that this endpoint should only be checked
	//for content of a certain type
	//if not present, all content will be checked against this endpoint
	"contentTypes": ["Image"]
}
],
```

```
//feeder-specific configuration
//for each feeder, we need a new struct, new field in AppConfig for it, and
//handling for the feeder in startAggregator()
"splunk-config": {
	"logFilePath": "/var/log/apps/pam.log"
}
```

# Environment Configuration
The app checks environments configuration as well as validation credentials every minute (configurable) and it reloads them if changes are detected.
The monitor can check publication across several different environments, provided each environment can be accessed by a single host URL. 

Configurations can be read either from ETCD or from files. 
If the `ETCD_PEERS` environment variable is set to `NOT_AVAILABLE`, then the configs will be read from files, otherwise from ETCD. 

## ETCD-based configuration
The monitor reads from `etcd` and watches for changes in the following paths:

`/ft/config/monitoring/read-urls`: a comma-separated list of _name_`:`_value_ pairs, mapping from environment name to base read URL, e.g. `env1:http://foo.example.org,env2:http://bar.example.org`

`/ft/config/monitoring/s3-image-bucket-urls`: a comma-separated list of _name_`:`_value_ pairs, mapping from environment name to base S3 URL, e.g. `env1:http://s3bucket1.org,env2:http://s3bucket2.org`

`/ft/_credentials/publish-read/read-credentials`: a comma-separated list of _name_`:`_username_`:`_password_ tuples, mapping from environment name to basic HTTP credentials, e.g. `env1:scott:tiger,env2:friend:frodo`. The _name_ must match a name in the read-urls key; if an environment does not require authentication, credentials should be omitted.

## File-based configuration
### JSON example for environments configuration:
 <pre>
     [
       {
         "name":"pre-prod-uk",
         "read-url": "https://pre-prod-uk.ft.com",
         "s3-url": "http://com.ft.imagepublish.amazonaws.com"
       },
       {
         "name":"pre-prod-us",
         "read-url": "https://pre-prod-us.ft.com",
         "s3-url": "http://com.ft.imagepublish.amazonaws.com"
       }       
     ]
 </pre>
### JSON example for environments credentials configuration:
 <pre>
 [
   {
         "env-name": "pre-prod-uk",
         "username": "dummy-username",
         "password": "dummy-pwd"
   },
   {
     "env-name": "pre-prod-us",
     "username": "dummy-username",
     "password": "dummy-pwd"
   }   
       
 ]
  </pre>
### JSON example for validation credentials configuration:
 <pre>
  {
    "username": "dummy-username",
    "password": "dummy-password"
  }
 </pre>
 
Checks that have already been initiated are unaffected by changes to the values above.

### Kubernetes details
In K8s we're using the File-based configuration for environments, and the files are actually contents
from ConfigMaps as following:

- *environments configuration* is read from `global-config` ConfigMap, key `pam.read.environments`
- *credentials configuration* is read from secret `publish-availability-monitor-secrets`, key `read-credentials`
- *validation credentials* configuration is read from secret `publish-availability-monitor-secrets`, key `validator-credentials`

These keys can be modified on the fly and they will be picked up by the application without restart with a tiny delay.
More details on how this works [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#mounted-configmaps-are-updated-automatically)
